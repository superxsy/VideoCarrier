Below is a practical **"tools-first" breakdown** plus a **8-week development calendar** leveraging existing open-source tools to minimize development effort.
Times assume one small cross-functional team (≈4–6 devs + 1 PM). Timeline compressed by utilizing mature open-source components.

## 1. Modular Tool Set

| #  | Tool / Micro-service          | Core Responsibility                                                        | Key Tech & Open-Source Components                     | Depends on |

| 7  | **TTS-Redub** (optional flag) | Rewrite script & synthesize Mandarin voiceover; mux new audio              | **PaddleSpeech/VoiceVox** + forced alignment + FFmpeg | 3·4        |
| 8  | **Bili-Publisher**            | Auth, upload, add cover, set tags, schedule                                | **bilibili-api** Python library; OAuth + upload APIs | 5·6·7      |
| 9  | **Workflow Orchestrator**     | State machine, retries, error reporting                                    | **AIBrix** + vLLM orchestration + Celery/Redis       | wraps 1-8  |
| 10 | **Ops & Dash**                | Web UI, logs, metrics, manual override                                     | React + Grafana/Prometheus + **VideoLingo** Streamlit UI | 9          |

## 2. Weekly Development Schedule (8 weeks)

### **Week 1: Foundation & Tool #1 (YouTube Downloader)**
- Set up development environment (Docker, K8s cluster, CI/CD)
- **Integrate yt-dlp**: Wrapper service with URL validation and metadata extraction
- Build download queue with retry logic using existing yt-dlp reliability
- **Deliverable**: Containerized downloader service with health checks

### **Week 2: Tool #2 (Subtitle Generator)**
- **Deploy VideoLingo/YT-Whisper**: Leverage existing ASR + translation pipeline
- Customize prompts for Chinese subtitle generation
- Implement subtitle timing and formatting logic
- **Deliverable**: ASR service with subtitle output in SRT format

### **Week 3: Tool #3 (Content Translator)**
- **Deploy vLLM + AIBrix**: Use proven inference acceleration stack
- Integrate Qwen2-72B model with custom translation prompts
- Build context-aware translation with video metadata
- **Deliverable**: Translation service with quality scoring

### **Week 4: Integration Sprint #1**
- Connect Tools #1-3 in pipeline
- Implement inter-service messaging (Celery/RabbitMQ)
- Build monitoring and logging infrastructure
- **Deliverable**: End-to-end pipeline for download → subtitle → translate

### **Week 5: Tool #4 (Category Tagger) + Tool #5 (Compliance Checker)**
- **Integrate wordscheck + sensitive-word**: Leverage existing filtering libraries
- Train classification model on Bilibili categories

### How the Sequence Works

1. **Data Plane First** – Fetch → transcode → ASR.
2. **Language Layer** – Translate + rewrite once reliable subtitles exist.
3. **Metadata Intelligence** – Tagger & Compliance operate on clean Chinese text.
4. **Optional Enhancement** – TTS only after the core pipeline is stable.
5. **Publishing Last** – Push to Bilibili once all upstream gates pass.
6. **Ops Overlay** – Observability and UI wrap the services once pipelines are green.

## 3. Open-Source Integration Strategy

### Key Benefits of This Approach

* **Development Time Reduction**: ~60% faster than building from scratch
* **Proven Stability**: All core components are battle-tested in production
* **Community Support**: Active maintenance and documentation
* **Cost Efficiency**: Focus resources on business logic rather than infrastructure

### Critical Integration Points

| Component | Integration Effort | Custom Development Required |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| **yt-dlp** | Low (wrapper only) | URL validation, metadata parsing |
| **VideoLingo** | Medium (API adaptation) | Prompt customization, output formatting |
| **vLLM + AIBrix** | Medium (deployment) | Model serving, load balancing |
| **wordscheck** | Low (API calls) | Custom rule sets, threshold tuning |
| **bilibili-api** | Medium (OAuth flow) | Upload progress, error handling |
| **PaddleSpeech** | High (audio pipeline) | Voice selection, quality optimization |

### Risk Mitigation

* **Fallback Plans**: Each open-source component has 2+ alternatives identified
* **Version Pinning**: Lock to stable releases, test upgrades in staging
* **Custom Patches**: Fork critical components if needed for China compliance
* **Performance Monitoring**: Establish baselines early, track regression

---

### Tips for Staying on Track

* **Definition-of-Done gates** at each tool: containerized, documented, unit-tested, emits clear success/fail JSON.
* **Open-source first**: Always evaluate existing solutions before custom development.
* **Daily stand-up demo clip** keeps latency/performance visible early.
* **Lock integration sprints** (Weeks 4 & 7) to bug-bash cross-tool issues before moving on.
* **Maintain shared proto/JSON contract repo**; breaking changes require team sign-off.
* **Community engagement**: Contribute back improvements to upstream projects.

Adjust the calendar to your team size. The TTS component can be deferred to Phase 2 if MVP speed is critical.
